## Step 0: If you are a participant in the training course

If you are a participant in the training course run by the Earlham Institute,
then you are not a self-guided student.
The trainers will go through the course material with you in the course.
You will be given login details to virtual machines by the organisers or the trainers.
These contain all the software and the data needed for the course.
So, steps 1 - 4 below do not apply to you.

## Step 1: Make sure we can help!

Check out the [target audience]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/audience) of the course and decide if you will benefit from interacting with these materials.

## Step 2: Decide your approach to the course.

As a self-guided student you can 1) follow along with the whole course at your own pace or 2) find a couple modules that will be helpful to you in isolation. 

## Step 3: Setup your computer

Make sure your computer is [setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup).

## Step 4: Give us feedback

Help us make sure you have a good experience by [providing feedback]({{ site.github.repo }}/issues).
