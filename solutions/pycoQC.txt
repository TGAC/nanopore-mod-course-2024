You should see that the file only contains reads from chrVI,
and that all reads are longer than 30 kb.
The dataset looks so because the instructors of the course
have performed such a subsetting.
You can confirm this by opening the file in IGV if you have time.
You should see that all reads overlap the region chrVI:150000-250000.
