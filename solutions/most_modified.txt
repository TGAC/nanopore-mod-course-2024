We've detailed a couple of solutions below.
There may be other ways of solving the problem.

Use our custom program to add the XC tag with modification counts
to the end of each BAM line.
Then, use `bedtools bamtobed -i $mod_bam -tag XC` to output reads in a
tabular format with the modification count in the fifth column.
Then, you can use one of two ways to find the most modified reads:
(1) You can sort by the fifth column in descending order to find the most
modified reads.
(2) You can use samtools filters and iteratively restrict them.
For example: `samtools view -c -e '[XC]>100'` counts reads with more than
100 modifications.
Keep increasing 100 till you get only a few reads or even only one read.
Then inspect this subset mod BAM file with `bedtools bamtobed` or `awk`
to get the read id(s).
