Ans: chrVI:190000-200000

Step 1: Isolate reads with modifications.

Use our script to form a mod BAM file with the XC tag
containg read modifcation counts.
Then, we isolate the modified strands.
We use the criterion that on average at least 5 thymidines
per every 100 thymidines must be modified.
So the modification rate must be at least 5% when we count only
thymidines, or 1.25% when we count all four canonical DNA bases.
Any other reasonable criterion is ok.

```bash
input_mod_bam=~/nanomod_course_data/yeast/subset_2.sorted.bam
thresholded_mod_bam= # fill suitably
modified_reads_mod_bam= # fill suitably

# perform thresholding
modkit call-mods --no-filtering $input_mod_bam $thresholded_mod_bam

cd ~/nanomod_course_scripts/nanopore-mod-course/code

# count number of modifications per read and select
# those where average modification rate > 1.25% as explained
# above
samtools view -h $thresholded_mod_bam | awk -f count_mods_per_read.awk |\
 samtools view -b -e '[XC]/rlen>0.0125' -o $modified_reads_mod_bam
```

Step 2:

One can subset this to retain reads above a read length or subsample
it to include only a fraction
e.g.: `samtools view -s 0.2 -e 'rlen>40000' -o $op_bam $modified_reads_mod_bam`.
This is an optional step.
We are not doing this as a part of this solution.

Step 3:

The command below produces statistics of the region chrVI:150000-160000.
Note down the statistics in the file `probabilities.txt` in the directory
./histogram_exercise and repeat this command for the other regions.
Remember that the top and the bottom rows of the file correspond to
the modified base and the unmodified base respectively.

```bash
region_file= # fill suitably
echo -e "chrVI\t150000\t160000\tA\t1000\t." > $region_file;   

# cd to a suitable folder

modkit sample-probs $modified_reads_mod_bam -o ./histogram_exercise \
  --hist --buckets 2 --include-bed $region_file --force
# --force above just overwrites files
# in the ./histogram_exercise directory
```
