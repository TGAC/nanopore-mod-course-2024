## Data Carpentry

Some of this site has been obtained from a repository which may have been developed in association with
[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/), which is a web and workshop based organization that is designed to teach 
basic computing concepts, skills, and tools for working with scientific data.

## Infrastructure

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) 
and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy.
