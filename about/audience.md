The long-term goal of this site is to help two groups of people:
1) Participants in a training course; and 2) Free-range
learners, or folks who aren't taking a formal class and are interested
in learning online on their own time. We are starting with the participants
and then attempting to build on the material generated to make
it maximally useful to the broader audience of biologists who want to
learn how to call modifications on nanopore data.
